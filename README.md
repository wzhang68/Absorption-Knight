## Gameplay Overview
The player controls the character movement via a touch-based interface. The main character (MC) should explore the island to meet different villagers, monsters, and bosses. MC has abilities to attack enemies and dodge their attack. After killing enemies, MC may absorb the special attack skills from the enemies. However, excessive killing will result in a decrease in mental value (sanity) which will debuff the character in different ways. The MC can also pray for monsters to increase the mental value. Additionally, the character can get missions from villagers and trade items.
