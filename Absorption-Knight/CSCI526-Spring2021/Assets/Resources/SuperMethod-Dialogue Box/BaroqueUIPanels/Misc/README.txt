I	- HOW TO USE:
		1)When installing this package, make sure the following folder structure is preserved:
			- "Assets/SuperMethod/BaroqueUIPanels ..."

		2)A prefab designed for your convenience is located at the following location:
			- "Assets/SuperMethod/BaroqueUIPanels/BaroqueUIPanel.prefab"

		This prefab is designed to style your UI panels in a global way. There is a styling script attached (PanelDriver.cs) which will
		allow you to conveniently choose which frame and underlay combination you prefer.

II	- USING THE PREFAB:
		1) "BaroqueUIPanels.prefab" is designed to let you conveniently style your UI panels. Any changes made using the attached script will
		make a commitment to the prefab itself. This ensures that all instantiations made from this prefab will display the same artwork.

		2) The attached script "PanelDriver.cs" has the following features within the Unity Inspector:
			-Chosen Frame		(The desired frame artwork.)
			-Chosen Underlay	(The desired underlay artwork.)
			-Set Display		(This button commits the desired changes to the prefab.)
			-Zero Position		(This button prefab's the object's default position.)

		3) Additionally, if you want the "global" functionallity of the prefab, but also want to use multiple styles in your game, you can simply
		create duplicate prefabs, each globally styled according to your needs.

		4) For now, the prefab includes a Text component to ensure compatibility. However, there's really no reason not to replace it with a TextMeshPro component!
		Simply delete the text component, add a TextMeshPro UI Text component, commit changes to the prefab and enjoy the superior functionality!

III	- USING THE ARTWORK WITHOUT THE PREFAB
		1) You can, of course, use the artwork however you see fit. The prefab and it's scripts are not necessary.
		
		2) Both frame and underlay artwork is intended to be displayed with "Image Type: Tiled"
