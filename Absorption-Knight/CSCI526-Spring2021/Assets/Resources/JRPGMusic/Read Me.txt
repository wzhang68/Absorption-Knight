Thanks for buying my Music Pack!!! This JRPG/RPG music pack contains 6 tracks (5 loops) 
of different kinds of RPG music, like fun theme, battle theme, title theme... This is the first pack I write
and I hope it will be very useful to you and your game!!

Check out my instagram page to keep following my content: iamlucasf_

If you like my music and wanna hire me to write custom music for your game, sent me an email 
at :Lucasferreira2101@gmail.com

I hope the best for you and your game. You don't need to give credit on your game if you dont want to, but I would
love how you use this, so i can share your game with my audience!

Thanks,
Lucas Ferreira
